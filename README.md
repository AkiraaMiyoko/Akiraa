PROJECT TITLE:
SEARCHING FOR AN ENTITY THAY DOESN'T EXIST/ SEARCHING FOR A NIL

-------------------

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Searching for an entity's storyline is made by me, however the name came from my cousin (since they suggested it to me and it's lowkey fire) and is inspired by the minecraft ARG; Searching for a world that doesn't exist. as for why it's named searchimg for a NIL, well the whole original title doesn't fit so I have to change. NIL basicaslly means nothing.

GENRE: HORROR (but not really scary ehe more of like a thriller) 

STORYLINE DESCRIPTION: (Since i cant write the whole storyline cuz its long so I'll summarize it.)
This project is about a young man/woman who find adventuring to horror houses thrilling. When they heard about the rumours of a  mysterious haunted house at the deep forest among the locals, they tried to search for it. 

Once they've found it, they went inside to explore, but what they didn't knwo is once thay you've gone inside, you can never go back.

GOAL:
You need to escape under 30 seconds in order to not get eaten by the entity. 

-----------------------

HOW TO PLAY:
Use arrows to move. Unfortunately I'm not used to playing WASD throughout the years so I changed the movement to arrows instead. (Sorry 😭)

Press enter to for the storyline to continue

Press R QUICKLY to restart before the game crashes. Im so sorry about this one because I'm too focused on the storyline and how the game works to the point that I have no tiem to debug the restart button. I have a major problem on this one since I struggle to debug the restart button. 

Yellow door - this door will be uou chance of escape against the mysterious entity. 

Keys (orange-yellowish small boxes) - you need to collect all of it under 30 seconds to escape throught the big yellow door and win the game. Collecting keys also increases your speed.

Walls (Grey boxes)- You must not BUMP onto it. If you bump on the walls, it will increase the bar of the noise level. 

NIL (Entity's name) - The entity is dependent on the sound you make. So you need to stay quiet!

If a key is stuck inside the wall, restart the game since the keys and walls are spawned randomly around the map.

AUTHOR'S NOTE:
I have watched numerous youtube tutorials on how I made the game and I'm lwk proud of my work.

The game may look basic, but I have no time to make it more appealing because I literally have no laptop or computer and I'm just using the computer of my cousin. I am happy that I have finished the game but I am not satisfied rhat much because it looks like theres a lot missing. Don't worry in the near future I will still continue working on this game but from a different language and will update it.

Also, I don't wanna lie about this one since I'm very guilty about it. The only time I used AI when it comes to my work is this. I admit I have used a AI code debugger and AI for the user to move (like the mathematics thing). Since I'm no expert to making one and I really have no experience. And that's the only thing I'm not proud about. I only did the variables, colors and the storyline. I'm no expert when it comes to making games like these since it's my first time but I fortunately I have learned some things when using AI. I may promise in the near future when updating this game, I will do this at my own. I very much dislike using AI on one of my orginal works as an IT since it's really a shame for me (legit tho) but I have no choice but to use it since i don't really have experiences.
